# HTML Project  - Event Page

Welcome to my HTML Project repository! This repository contains the final code for the completed project.This aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about HTML and guide you through building two exciting projects: an Event Page and a project focused on Tables and Forms.

## Project: Event Page

In this project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. Throughout this project, you will learn how to use the following HTML elements:

- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements and create an appealing Event Page.
